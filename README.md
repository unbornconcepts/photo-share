This project is an HTML 5 mobile application based on Google's Web Starter Kit and integrates Cordova for building native IOS and Android apps.

## Getting Started

It is important to read over the included [Web Start Kit docs](docs/wsk.md) to get a good understanding of an overview of WSK.

Be sure to look over the [installation docs](docs/install.md) to verify your environment is prepared to run WSK.

Once you have verified that your system can run WSK, check out the [commands](docs/commands.md) available to get started.

## iOS

The project includes a couple of iOS plugins to provide better control over some of the native controls.
